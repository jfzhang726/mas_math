In a non-Abelian group, there exist elements that do not commute with each other. When we form a factor group by quotienting out a normal subgroup, the elements in the factor group correspond to cosets of the normal subgroup.

If K is a normal subgroup of H, it means that for any element h in H and any element k in K, the conjugate of k by h (hkh^(-1)) is still in K. Similarly, if H is a normal subgroup of G, for any element g in G and any element h in H, the conjugate of h by g (ghg^(-1)) is still in H. \nNow, if we consider an element g in G and an element k in K, we can write k as (hk)h^(-1) for some h in H (since K is a subgroup of H).
