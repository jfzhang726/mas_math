ld create a risk that a
						larger monetary policy response might be required in coming months, especially if inflation pressures
						turned out to be stronger than expected. More generally, members noted that it was important to prevent
						inflation expectations from increasing significantly, given the costs of that eventuality. They agreed
						there was a risk of inflation expectations increasing if the Board left the cash rate target unchanged at
						this meeting, particularly given the Board’s repeated statements that it has a low tolerance for
						inflation returning to target after 2025. Members also noted that the staff’s inflation forecasts
						would be for higher inflation if they had not been predicated on one or two rate rises.
Members discussed the implications of this decision on household finances. While some households were
						benefiting from rising house prices, substantial savings buffers and higher interest income, others were
						experiencing a painful squeeze on their finances. Members noted that a larger-than-typical share of
						borrowers had been drawing down funds in their offset accounts – even while households in aggregate
						continued to build up balances in offset accounts – which was consistent with those households
						finding it harder to finance their expenditure from current incomes. At the same time, members observed
						that this share had not risen over prior months and that banks had not seen a significant rise in the
						incidence of households experiencing difficulties making their mortgage payments. Nonetheless, financial
						pressures on households would be exacerbated by inflation remaining higher for a longer period than
						forecast.
Members agreed that whether further tightening of monetary policy is required to ensure that inflation
						returns to target in a reasonable timeframe would depend on how the incoming data alter the economic
						outlook and the evolving assessment of risk
