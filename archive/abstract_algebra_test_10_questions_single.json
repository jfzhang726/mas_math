A factor group, also known as a quotient group, is formed by taking a normal subgroup of a group and forming the quotient of the original group by that subgroup. Since we are starting with a non-Abelian group, it means that there exist elements in the group that do not commute. Taking the factor group will not change this property, so the resulting factor group will also be non-Abelian.\n\nStatement 2: If K is a normal subgroup of H and H is a normal subgroup of G, then K is a normal subgroup of G.\nThis statement is also true. If K is a normal subgroup of H, it means that it is invariant under conjugation by elements of H. Similarly, if H is a normal subgroup of G, it means that it is invariant under conjugation by elements of G. Since conjugation is an operation that preserves normality, it follows that K, being a normal subgroup of H, will also be invariant under conjugation by elements of G, making it a normal subgroup of G.\n\nBased on the analysis above, the correct answer is:\n\n{Answer: A}"

A ring homomorphism is said to be one-to-one (or injective) if and only if the kernel of the homomorphism is {0}. The kernel of a ring homomorphism is the set of elements in the domain that map to the additive identity of the codomain.
