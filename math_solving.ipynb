The notation (1, 2, 5, 4)(2, 3) means a permutation that swaps 2 and 3 and cycles 1, 2, 5, and 4. \\n\\nWe can start by considering the elements that are affected by the cycle (1, 2, 5, 4). In this cycle, 1 goes to 2, 2 goes to 5, 5 goes to 4, and 4 goes to 1. Therefore, the cycle (1, 2, 5, 4) consists of 4 elements.\\n\\nNext, we consider the elements that are affected by the transposition (2, 3). The transposition (2, 3) swaps 2 and 3, so it affects two elements.\\n\\nTo determine the number of elements affected by both the cycle and transposition, we need to find the elements that are in both cycles. In this case, the element 2 is in both cycles. Therefore, the total number of elements affected by both the cycle and transposition is 1.\\n\\nNow, let's calculate the index of <p> in S_5. In S_5, there are 5! = 5*4*3*2*1 = 120 possible permutations of the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. \\n\\nSince there are 4 elements in the cycle (1, 2, 5, 4) and 2 elements in the transposition (2, 3), there are (4-1)! * (2-1)! = 3! * 1! = 6 possible permutations that can be obtained from the cycle and transposition.\\n\\nFinally, we need to subtract the number of elements affected by both the cycle and transposition, which is 1. So, the total number of elements not in <p> is 6 - 1 = 5.\\n\\nTherefore, the index of <p> in S_5 is 120 - 5 = 115.\\n\\nThe correct choice is not listed among the given options.\",\n",

Let's go through the question again.\\n\\nGiven the permutation p = (1, 2, 5, 4)(2, 3) in S_5, we want to find the index of the subgroup <p> in S_5.\\n\\nTo determine the index of <p>, we need to count the number of distinct permutations that can be generated by the elements of <p>. \\n\\nFirst, let's consider the cycle (1, 2, 5, 4). This cycle consists of four elements, which means it can be arranged in 4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24 different ways.\\n\\nNext, let's look at the transposition (2, 3). The transposition swaps 2 and 3. Since transpositions are their own inverses, we can generate two different permutations using this transposition alone: (2, 3) and (3, 2).\\n\\nTo calculate the total number of distinct permutations, we multiply the number of arrangements from the cycle (24) by the number of transpositions (2). Therefore, the total number of distinct permutations is 24 * 2 = 48.\\n\\nSince the index of <p> in S_5 is the ratio of the total number of permutations in S_5 to the total number of distinct permutations available in <p>, we divide 5! (120) by 48. \\n\\nThe index of <p> in S_5 is 120 / 48 = 2.5.\\n\\nHowever, the given choices for the index are A: 8, B: 2, C: 24, and D: 120. None of these choices match the correct answer.\",\n",

A factor group, also known as a quotient group, is formed by taking a normal subgroup of a group and forming the quotient of the original group by that subgroup.

If K is a normal subgroup of H, it means that it is invariant under conjugation by elements of H.
